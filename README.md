Tomato Maturity Classification using HSV and K-means Clustering

This repository contains a MATLAB-based GUI application to classify tomato maturity levels (ripe, half-ripe, unripe) using HSV color features and K-means clustering.

---

Overview
Tomato maturity classification is essential for agricultural quality control. This project provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in MATLAB that allows users to upload tomato images, process them in HSV color space, apply clustering with K-means, and determine the maturity level.

Methods
1. Image Preprocessing
   - Input: tomato image (JPG/PNG).  
   - Conversion from RGB â†’ HSV.  

2. Feature Extraction
   - Extracted Hue, Saturation, Value components.  
   - Built feature array for clustering.  

3. K-means Clustering
   - Cluster count: `k = 3`  
   - Identified groups for:  
     - Matang (Ripe)  
     - Setengah Matang (Half-ripe) 
     - Mentah (Unripe)  

4. Classification
   - Cluster assignment based on HSV thresholds.  
   - Output displayed as text label.  

5. Visualization
   - Original tomato image displayed.  
   - 3D scatter plot of clustering result (Hue-Saturation-Value).
